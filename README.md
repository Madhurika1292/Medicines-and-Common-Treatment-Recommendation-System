Medicines and Common Treatment Recommendation System

It is possible to observe rising health information needs and improvements in information seeking behavior all over the world. 81 % use the Internet, according to recent studies, and 59 % say they have searched for health information about diseases, diagnoses, and various treatments online. As educated patients raise questions or discuss treatment options, such effects influence the patient-physician relationship. Thus, in the decision-making process, patients tend to become active participants. Patient empowerment is often referred to as this shift in the way of thought.
Medicine and a common treatment recommendation system can help patients or medical care providers choose the best medication for various symptoms or conditions. This system would also prescribe other typical treatments based on the conditions faced by patients.
Such recommendation systems will help improve the innovative technology available today that can contribute to more concise decisions. Based on various algorithms, several current recommendation systems are being developed.
In order to recognize the benefits and drawbacks of the various approaches, my project aims to outline multiple methods of developing recommendation systems for each type and eventually provide a recommendation on the best approach to creating a medicine and common treatment recommendation system.


##Data Source-
Below data sources will be used to build this recommendation system –
•	https://www.drugs.com/ -
a.	The most reliable, up-to-date drug knowledge is offered by this source. This would be used to obtain the patients' updated reviews and additional details such as conditions relevant to the medication.
b.	Additional or optional care recommendations from this source will be scrapped based on the conditions.
•	http://www.druglib.com/ -
a.	 It is another source that will be used to provide the drug feedback and extra reviews such as effectiveness, side effects, scores.
•	https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+Review+Dataset+%28Druglib.com%29 –
a.	This source provides the data in the csv formats referred to in the points above.
•	https://www.webmd.com/ -
a.	This source offers the patients' review along with the age, useful information of the count.
b.	This will mainly be used for analysis of exploratory data.


##Goal-
To create a recommendation system that will suggest medications and optional treatments based on reviews and conditions of patients.
In order to provide recommendations based on conditions and collective filtering methods, I will incorporate various content-based filtering approaches to provide recommendations based on patient feedback.
In clustering-based algorithms, matrix factorization-based algorithms and deep learning, I will research and compare the various models.
To compare the models, I will be using metrics such as RMSE, MSE, ROC / AUC, Similarity score, Novelty. By using data from the data sources described above, the proposed medicine and treatment recommendation system uses machine learning recommendation approaches, and the best one will be selected for the recommendation system to achieve metrics such as good accuracy, scalability, and model performance.
